Below, you will find a summary of the performance tests carried out on your website.

Running tools like Lighthouse, or https://www.webpagetest.org/, or similar, help detect some areas of improvement.
The data and the report generated by these tools must be interpreted with full awareness of the implementation details, as the report defines the purely theoretical aspects. However, it can be a helpful starting point for planning some improvements. We will not go into the implementation of the front end. We will take a cue from this report to see if any optimizations can be made on the Storyblok or the content modeling side, such as optimizing images or defining specific fields to improve SEO or usability.


{% for audit in data.getBlock("audits") %}
{% if audit.score < 0.7 and audit.score != '' %}
{% if audit["id"] in fileNames %}
## {{ audit["title"] }} {{ audit["id"] }}
{{ audit["description"] }}

### Storyblok hint
{{ include('hints/' ~ audit["id"] ~ '.md', ignore_missing = true) }}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
